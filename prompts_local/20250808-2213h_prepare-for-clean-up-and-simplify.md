# Preparation: Clean Up and Simplify

Session: 2025-08-08 22:13
Goal: Reduce complexity, remove duplication, and tighten output.

Scope:
- Exclude logic: keep grep-style; extract a single helper used by both traversal and .DS_Store phases
- Remove any unused prune/find scaffolding and variables
- Logging: in verbose, show high-signal lines only; add a one-line summary of excludes
- Tests: add minimal script-driven checks for depth-first, excludes, and .DS_Store timestamp preservation
- Documentation: update help to explicitly state "grep-style" exclude patterns

Steps:
1) Create helper `should_exclude_dir(start_dir, candidate_dir, patterns...)` implementing grep-style rules
2) Replace in both loops; delete duplicated code paths and leftover prune code
3) Run bash -n and quick smoke tests on small trees
4) Trim verbose noise; ensure --verbose is actionable
5) Update --help text with examples: '.conda_env/' and 'project/repos/'

Success Criteria:
- One helper for excludes used everywhere
- No traversal or .DS_Store creation in excluded subtrees
- Depth-first propagation remains correct
- Verbose output is concise and clear
- Help text reflects grep-style behavior with examples
