## High Priority

### üåê Cross-Platform Support for System Files
**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: Medium

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Add OS detection (`uname -s`)
- [ ] Create OS-specific exclusion lists
- [ ] Update file iteration logic to exclude OS-specific files
- [ ] Add command-line option to override OS detection
- [ ] Update documentation with cross-platform examples
- [ ] Test on Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL)

### üéØ Advanced Pattern Matching
**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
