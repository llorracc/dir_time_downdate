# Chat Session Summary: Clean Up and Simplify

Date: 2025-08-08 22:13

Highlights:
- Exclude semantics reduced to grep-style (slash → path match, no slash → basename; trailing "/" = dir)
- Depth-first traversal fixed (-depth) so timestamps propagate from deepest leaf up to root
- .DS_Store creation implemented with directory timestamp preservation and placed after timestamp sync
- Read-only dirs handled during .DS_Store writes and original perms restored
- Version bumped to v0.3.1 and tagged (exclude-pattern-follows-grep)
- `.specstory/` removed from tracking and ignored going forward

Next Up – Clean Up & Simplify:
- Remove dead code and legacy prune scaffolding
- Consolidate exclude logic (single helper; avoid duplication between traversal and .DS_Store phase)
- Tighten verbose output (high-signal, avoid noise)
- Add lightweight tests for: depth-first behavior, exclude patterns, .DS_Store timestamp preservation
- Review error handling and exit codes
- Ensure comments reflect current behavior; delete stale comments
